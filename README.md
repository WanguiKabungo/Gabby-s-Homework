# Gabby-s-Homework
Gabby's Homework is Wangui's first HTML project she did on her own 
since joining Adam's class. 
This webpage basically contains her thoughts on Valentine's Day
and what the perfect Valentine's Day would look for her. 

Evidently she has not yet mastered writing a README but we have to start somewhere.
The only language used is HTML because so far it's the only language she knows.
Looking firward to learning more languages and being able to incorporate them
especially CSS to make it prettier.
