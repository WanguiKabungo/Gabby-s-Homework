    <h1>Valentine's Day Celebration </h1>
    <h2>Activities done on Valentine's Day</h2>
    <p>On Valentine's Day, people get up to alot of activities. Usually trying to "show up and show up for their partners.
        There is a lot of love in the air and a lot of legs as well. 
        I, unfortunately, did not celebrate it how I would have liked but if I had,
        below are soem of the things I'd have loved. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>A bouquet of my favourite flowers, lillies and/or peonies</li>
            <li>A card confessing undying love and lowkey a healthy obsession</li>
            <li>Dinner at a restaurant where I get to dress up</li>
            <li>Chocolates and a bottle of good red, dry wine</li>
            <li>A gift, an watch, a dress, a pair of shoes or even an experience</li>
            <li>A movie in pjs or not, those are optional really lol, eating icecream while cuddled up</li>
        </ol>
     <p>That might sound like a lot but is it though? I don't believe so.</p>
